ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* ic_launcher-web.png
* proguard-project.txt

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => app\src\main\assets
* libs\ftplet-api-1.1.1.jar => app\libs\ftplet-api-1.1.1.jar
* libs\ftpserver-core-1.1.1.jar => app\libs\ftpserver-core-1.1.1.jar
* libs\log4j-1.2.17.jar => app\libs\log4j-1.2.17.jar
* libs\mina-core-2.0.16.jar => app\libs\mina-core-2.0.16.jar
* libs\slf4j-api-1.7.21.jar => app\libs\slf4j-api-1.7.21.jar
* libs\slf4j-log4j12-1.7.21.jar => app\libs\slf4j-log4j12-1.7.21.jar
* libs\support-v4-23.jar => app\libs\support-v4-23.jar
* lint.xml => app\lint.xml
* res\ => app\src\main\res\
* src\ => app\src\main\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
